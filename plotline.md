# Main Plot
Stormy and Sparky arrive to Stormhacks late! Watch as they madly try to win a prize, make sponsors notice them, and maybe more??



Characters:
- Stormy \[Sub]
- Sparky \[Dom]
- Player

Moral of the story:
- Don't be late to a hackathon .w. like actually just don't

Initial Plot:
\[Player] and Sparky show up at the hackathon abhorrently late â€” at 1am. They scramble to get checked-in and settled down at a table to start deciding on a project. Not long after, Stormy approaches them also having arrived late. He shyly explains that he doesn't want to work alone, and wishes to join their group. Thus begins a story of newfound friendship, perhaps even a *spark* igniting between them, as they *surge* through the *storm*.




Minigame:
Win/Lose based on chunks of code it gives you, where the player decides whether or not to commit the code to their repository. If you commit malicious code, you'll lose points and vice versa. If you score is positive by the end, you win and your project does well. Otherwise, the project breaks your computer and you go home dejected. If you don't answer in time, your project never gets finished, but it's a neutral ending and you all still remain friends.
