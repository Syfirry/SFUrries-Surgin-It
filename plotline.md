Characters:
- Stormy \[Sub]
- Sparky \[Dom]
- Player

Moral of the story:
- Don't be late to a hackathon .w. like actually just don't

Initial Plot:
\[Player] and Sparky show up at the hackathon abhorrently late â€” at 1am. They scramble to get checked-in and settled down at a table to start deciding on a project. Not long after, Stormy approaches them also having arrived late. He shyly explains that he doesn't want to work alone, and wishes to join their group. Thus begins a story of newfound friendship, perhaps even a *spark* igniting between them, as they *surge* through the *storm*.
